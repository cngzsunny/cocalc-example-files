CoCalc LaTeX Support
====================

[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) allows you to run LaTeX online in a full Linux environment.
It supports the standard compilers, `latexmk`, and a large number of libraries are pre-installed.
On top of that, support for `SageTeX` and `PythonTeX` adds the capability of running SageMath or Python code
right inside of TeX files to seamlessly embed code, results, formulas and plots.


* [`multiple-files`](./multiple-files) demonstrates how to setup a larger LaTeX document with multiple source files
* [`sagetex`](./sagetex) shows how to run SageMath inside a document
* [`pythontex`](./pythontex) features an example file for running PythonTeX
* [`presentation`](./presentation) contains a basic beamer presentation template
