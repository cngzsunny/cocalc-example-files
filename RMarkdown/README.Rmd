## Introduction

RMarkdown allows you to write a HTML document, a scientific article, a presentation (interactive website or LaTeX beamer), or even a book by just using [Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html) syntax and embedded programming code.
The "**R**" in RMarkdown stands for the [R statistical computing](https://www.R-project.org/) language,
but it also supports [Python](https://www.python.org) and many other langauges.

To make full use of this approach, look at the included example documents,
the [articles](./rticle) and make sure to check out advanced concepts like the "frontmatter" -- which you can see at the top between the triple dashes -- to configure the document.

For example, you can use a [bibtex file](readme.bib) to collect other documents.
Use it to include a reference in your file like for R (@R-base), SageMath (@sagemath) and CoCalc [@cocalc].

Of course, you can include formulas like $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$ and much more ...

## Included documents
